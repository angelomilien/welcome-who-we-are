# Who We Are

## Introduction

Effective learning comes not just from consuming educational content, but from
connecting with the people who are learning and teaching it. By innovating on
both teaching techniques and technology, we bring together passionate
instructors and driven students in an unparalleled experience.

We launched our on-campus program at our flagship NYC campus in 2012 and
expanded access to this transformative programming in 2015 by launching our
online program through our Learn.co learning platform. To ensure that our
education would be effective in any format, we built this program around three
core ideas:

- **Real tools** – to ensure students are prepared for roles by using the tools
  and workflows that they will use on the job;
- **Open curriculum** – to ensure what we’re teaching is always relevant by
  integrating real-time feedback from instructors and our community; and
- **Community** – to make sure that our students learn, but not alone.

## Flatiron School Values

of who we are and how we get such remarkable results. We believe that if we can
all behave by these guiding principles, amazing things will happen:

## Learners Mindset

Our goal is to transform students into professionals. Through helping thousands
of students gain new skills and transform their careers, we’ve seen that
students who are most successful in this program are the ones who exemplify what
we call a “learners mindset”: being scrappy, patient, adaptable, mindful,
self-reflective, communicative, and open. Here’s more detail on what that
means:

Act like an owner

Own your education and experience in this program, ask for help when you need it
and be resourceful.

Be patient and expect delayed gratification

Learning a new skillset takes time and patience to master. Give yourself that
time.

Be adaptable and handle ambiguity

To be a lifelong learner, it’s critical to be able to be comfortable in not
knowing the answer (yet).

Be mindful

Self-awareness of how you work best is key. Create your own structure that helps
you work effectively.

Communicate effectively

Actively read the lessons and reflect on what you’ve learned, complete the labs,
listen to your Support Team at Flatiron, and to each other and raise questions
and feedback along the way.

> good learners. Beginners are. No matter how much we already know, a beginner’s
